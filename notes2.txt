PROBLEMS
- how best to save passwords? save password for admin and
username in the same place? // Solution? Hard code admin username/password add diferent functions for validation for admin and
ordinary users.
function for all form fields
- how to check passwords /// Solution? you can use the same form functions EXCEPT THE EXPLICT VALIDATION functions
these need to be separate functions.
- how best to add some level of security to text files? Store not on the same root directory as website. If on the same directory as website
the user can simply navigate to the text files.
- how to record logged out status on index page? USE GET superglobal on logout BUTTON
something like logout.php?message=loggedout.
- Generally how to manage login/logout - where to direct user. You don't want to see form again. Not relevant.
- How to handle duplicates? Turns out you need another error message. Normal error message won't suffice -

if (isset(message)){
display message
}
else{
do nothing
}

use regenerate sessionid for escalation in access level.
