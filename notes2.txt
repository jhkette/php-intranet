1) Set up admin login
  - create form
  - send to welcome page if valid
  - redisplay form if invalid
2)check sessions for admin login
3) Add session if statement to results pages
4) add function that reads text file and creates an array from first two items. This is then
passed on to validation functions.
5) create admin page that add users. This needs to be a sticky form. Use prior sticky form as model.
6) create write functionality to file that adds users. Need to find end of file. then write to it. Need
to use a commma as a delimiter(should be banned from form inputs to avoid errors)



7) The header, footer and navigation (in the header need to be php files)  - this can be done later,
probably one of the last things to be done.




PROBLEMS
- how best to save passwords? save password for admin and
username in the same place? Ie on a text file - use the same form
function for all form fields
- how to check passwords 
- how best to add some level of security to text files? Store not on the same root directory as website. If on the same directory as website
the user can simply navigate to the text files.
- how to record logged out status on index page? USE GET superglobal on logout BUTTON
something like logout.php?message=loggedout.

if (isset(message)){
display message
}
else{
do nothing
}

use regenerate sessionid for escalation in access level.
